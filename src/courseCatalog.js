Description: "The construction and production of race and racisms are key elements in the socio-historical development of both Southern Africa and the United States. Comparative inquires of this nature typically begin with the United States and look for exemplars in other parts of the world. This course takes a somewhat different tack by centering Southern Africa (primarily South Africa and Namibia) to consider what Southern African societies can teach us, in the United States, not only about the production and consequences of race and racisms, but also about decolonization and dismantling the legacy of race and racism in a society and its institutions. The course will start with a broad historical sweep to consider what was happening in Southern Africa before the onset of colonization and continue up to the present, including the #FeesMustFall student revolt of October 2015 and beyond.",

This course interrogates the slippery concept of violence in the light of theoretical approaches from different disciplines. The course will begin with a discussion of how anthropologists have reexamined the concept of violence within the context of complex and large-scale societies. It will then address the preponderate weight that the concept of the state has played within the social sciences in interpretation of violence, followed by a consideration of how notions of community and cultural difference figure prominently in the ideology of conflict.

Departments: ["Art and Art History"],
DistributionReq: "",
GeneralEds: [],
Description: "Founded by poets, writers, artists, photographers, and film-makers in Paris in the early 1920s, Surrealism quickly spread to many corners of the globe. By 1929, when the Surrealist Map of the World was published, France had disappeared, the US and Canada were removed, and the Pacific Ocean became the center of the world. An anti-colonial diatribe, the Surrealistsâ€™ map drew attention to many other important places -- Mexico, Latin America, the Caribbean, Russia, and Africa--where the Surrealist imaginary flourished, shaping identities and confronting diverse forms of oppression. Examining art, film, and theoretical perspectives that framed surrealist goals and practices from the 1920s to the present, we will address topics such as amour fou (mad love), convulsive beauty, the fantastic, the uncanny, language and madness, black humor, magic and occult, Negritude, and Afro-Surrealism.",

All of these elements can be considered and affected by design choices which we make. In the class we build structures which can be considered from structural, aesthetic, and functional points of view. Some of these projects are built to very specific parameters so that trade-offs can be observed and measured. We smash a lot of things, but learn a lot about problem-solving along the way. The course includes a field trip to my farm/studio in Western Wisconsin where we install a large site-specific project. Past projects have included a collaboratively-built ninety-three foot long illuminated lantern across the pastures, as well as a series of kinetic structures. The food is great too!",

Description: "Mindfulness, a state of active, open (non-judgmental) attention on the present, is as Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh puts it, “the most reliable source of peace and joy”.  It has roots in Buddhism, however, most religious traditions practice some form of meditation or prayer which helps to gain a broader perspective on life and an appreciation of the present.  A rapidly growing body of scientific evidence supports the findings that meditation can have a profound effect on our health and well-being, often through stress reduction.  The practice of mindfulness meditation emerged into mainstream medicine, in part, through the efforts of Professor emeritus Jon Kabat-Zinn, who is the founder and former director of the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center.   MBSR techniques and training are now used in many clinical and academic settings, including Macalester College.    MBSR and other meditation techniques have been shown to have a profound effect on reducing stress, lowering blood pressure, reducing chronic pain and more.  In this class, we will read and discuss research articles on the “science of mindfulness” and how mindfulness practices impact our health and well-being.   You will also be writing a multi-draft review paper on a related topic and presenting your findings to the class.   One of my main goals for this class is to reduce stress and promote individual health, developing practices for now and future present moments.  For this reason, I will ask students to commit to a daily of practice of mindfulness.  Training in these practices will be part of the class.  Prerequisite: One of the following classes: BIOL356 (Cellular/Molecular Neuroscience), BIOL360 (Neuroanatomy), BIOL367 (Human Physiology), PSYC244 (Cognitive Neuroscience), PSYC246 (Exploring Sensation & Perception), PSYC248 (Behavioral Neuroscience) OR permission of the instructor.",

The emphasis throughout the course will be on the use of computers to make predictions, instead of the mathematics and physics underlying quantum mechanics.  The second half of the course focuses on research projects possibly leading to publication.

We will analyze various forms of popular culture—including popular music, fast food, television, comics, film, fashion, and sports. Stress is placed on how East Asians receive and consume popular culture texts, how the transnational flows of commodities and culture impact local societies and individual identities, and how East Asian popular culture participates in the shifts and turns in global cultural experiences. We will discover how popular culture not only entertains, but is also a site where meanings are produced, shared, and contested. It affects how we view ourselves as individuals and in relation to others, simultaneously reflecting and transforming ideologies and values in society. Therefore, this course on popular culture is also about modern East Asia itself—its changing historical and social process.  No prior knowledge of Asia or Asian Languages is required.",

Description: "This course examines the role of Education as global phenomena. The course encompasses a comparative view of education around the world, as well as its role in International Development. We take it further, by analysis and critique, to understand education as a force for change in an inter-dependent, globalized world. Specifically, we will examine ways in which policies and practice either enhance or diminish efforts towards change that is inclusive, just, sustainable and effective in relieveing suffering, while expanding potential and capacity in those affected by social change. We take the position that, in order to be effective, building trust becomes a key to connectivity between people, groups, organizations and ideas where education, development and change are theorized and practiced. We will construct possible education frameworks around the idea of building trust, by analyzing socio-cultural issues of power, voice, silence, and discourse. (4 credits)",

Description: "Geologists tell us that we have entered a new epoch called the Anthropocene, when humans have fundamentally reshaped the planet in ways that put the future of life at risk. This course will consider questions like: When did the Anthropocene begin? Who has the power to define an epoch? How have we represented environmental disasters in the past and present? What are the stories we tell ourselves about human’s relationship to the Earth? Where do we find hope for our futures? A timely look at the concept of “The Anthropocene” provides us with special opportunities for self-reflection, debate and expression. Our fiction and non-fiction readings, film screenings and experiential learning will help us answer if there could be such a thing as a “good” Anthropocene rather than simply an apocalyptic one. We will develop our writing and research skills working on collaborative projects with the Twin Cities as our backdrop. This interdisciplinary course is being co-taught by faculty from three different departments: Andrea Kaston Tange (English), John Kim (Media and Cultural Studies) and Roopali Phadke (Environmental Studies).  Students can select which section to join, but all sections will cover the same material and meet at the same time. Students will spend time in their individual section, have opportunities to work with the other two professors, occasionally meet up in one large group that includes all three sections, and take local and regional field trips together.",

Emerson, Hawthorne, Stowe, Thoreau, Douglass, Melville, Dickinson, Whitman, and Jacobs - together these artists produced a canon of literature that revealed both the demons and angels of our histories and futures. They invented a spiritual movement of unprecedented optimism at the same time that they despaired over what they had become. Everything that was written in the US afterwards would have to come to terms with the brilliant and disturbing achievements of this cluster of outsiders, mystics, and heroes. In this course we will read the landmark texts of this era from literary, historical, and philosophical perspectives.",

Description: "This capstone course for the Literature Path is the culminating academic experience of the major. The course consists of three interlocking objectives. The first goal is to provide students with the opportunity to develop an original research project that reflects their deepest aesthetic interests and ethical commitments. Working closely with a faculty member and a small group of peers, students will develop projects that display rigorous literary scholarship and methodological inventiveness. The second goal is to provide instruction in advanced methods of research by studying influential critical approaches from the early twentieth century to the present. Specific theories and methods will be determined in consultation with the instructor. Past courses have emphasized psychoanalysis, post-Marxist criticism, gender, queer, and feminist theory, phenomenology, critical race theory, black feminist theory, post-colonial criticism, poetics, law and human rights, and aesthetics. The final goal is to train students to become advocates of their research agenda. Students will learn to lecture and lead discussion on relevant readings and to share their research with the wider intellectual community in a form that reflects the spirit of the project. Prerequisite(s): One prior English course numbered in the 100s (excluding 101 or 150), plus one literature course at the 200- or 300- level. Capstone courses are intended to be a culminating experience for the major. Students without Senior status will need instructor permission to enroll.",

Departments: ["Environmental Studies"],
DistributionReq: "",
GeneralEds: [],
Description: "Geologists tell us that we have entered a new epoch called the Anthropocene, when humans have fundamentally reshaped the planet in ways that put the future of life at risk. This course will consider questions like: When did the Anthropocene begin? Who has the power to define an epoch? How have we represented environmental disasters in the past and present? What are the stories we tell ourselves about human’s relationship to the Earth? Where do we find hope for our futures? A timely look at the concept of “The Anthropocene” provides us with special opportunities for self-reflection, debate and expression. Our fiction and non-fiction readings, film screenings and experiential learning will help us answer if there could be such a thing as a “good” Anthropocene rather than simply an apocalyptic one. We will develop our writing and research skills working on collaborative projects with the Twin Cities as our backdrop. This interdisciplinary course is being co-taught by faculty from three different departments: Andrea Kaston Tange (English), John Kim (Media and Cultural Studies) and Roopali Phadke (Environmental Studies).  Students can select which section to join, but all sections will cover the same material and meet at the same time. Students will spend time in their individual section, have opportunities to work with the other two professors, occasionally meet up in one large group that includes all three sections, and take local and regional field trips together.",

Description: "Combustion of fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide, which traps energy near Earth's surface and leads to warmer average global temperatures. Combustion of fossil fuels also forms the backbone of the modern economy. This team-taught course provides a framework in which to consider the costs and benefits of fossil fuel consumption in the present and over the coming decades and centuries. We use concepts from climate science and environmental economics to evaluate existing and proposed policy interventions designed to reduce fossil fuel consumption, and consider possible technological solutions to slow or reverse climate change. Among our main approaches are state-of-the-art Integrated Assessment Models; students will be exposed to several of the most commonly used models and to research from their critics. This course counts as a Group E elective. Students signing up for the course as Economics will get credit toward the social sciences general distribution requirement; those signing up for the course as Environmental Studies will get credit toward the natural sciences and mathematics general distribution requirement.

Description: "The Earth's climate system is complex and dynamic, and yet understanding this system is crucial in order to address concerns about anthropogenic influences on climate. In this course, we examine the basic physical and chemical processes that control the modern climate system, including the role of incoming solar radiation, the greenhouse effect, ocean and atmospheric circulation, and El Nino. We also look critically at the methods and archives used to reconstruct climate in the past, such as ice cores, marine and lake sediments, and cave deposits. We explore the possible effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions on modern and future climate by critically examining the models used in climate prediction, and discuss the challenges of modeling such a complex system. Although this course is taught from a primarily scientific perspective, it includes frequent discussions of the roles policy and economics play in the current dialogue on global climate change.",

Early in the semester, all students will participate in a weekend retreat at the Ordway Field Station. Weekly lab sessions will include field days during which course members design and implement educational experiences for elementary school children at Ordway, small group work days for preparing field day lesson plans, trips to local outdoor environmental education sites within the Twin Cities, and other experiential learning opportunities.  Weekly seminar sessions incorporating readings, reflective writing, and individual and small group projects complement the experiential aspects of the course. As the semester progresses, each course member will develop a curricular unit aimed at teaching an important environmental issue to diverse adolescents attending urban public schools.  The curricular unit is a significant undertaking that provides students with the opportunity to synthesize all aspects of the course material in a creative, pragmatic and integrative manner.",

We will work through different global change “modules” that look at climate change, land use change, biodiversity loss, and environmental health, with each module focusing on a different region of the planet and equitable solutions to those problems.  This course will involve science communication to different audiences through an array of formats – potentially including infographics, op-ed essays, online data dissemination, and policy assessments – so that students can practice engaging with and producing informed, effective scientific content.  We aim to spend the semester focusing on environmental problems and solutions on a changing planet while pointing a spotlight at regions that will be impacted first and most severely by global change.

The course is thus not a systematic survey of all French and francophone literature, but we will study many different genres (film, theater, autobiography, short story, essay, novel, poetry, song) and several different time periods to explore how empathy has been expressed in French and francophone societies over the centuries.  We will also work on a number of writing projects that will prepare you for upper-level courses in French and for study abroad in France or a francophone region.  This course is taught in French.

Description: "This course is designed to provide a broad overview of documentary practices in francophone Africa, from colonial-era informational and educational cinema to the wide range of genres obtaining in the current postcolonial period (docudramas, ecocritical documentaries, mockumentaries, web-i-docs, etc.). This exploratory journey through the non-fiction film in francophone Africa will be staged around three major “historical” signposts: the end of colonialism and the so-called 'birth' of francophone African cinema on the banks of the Seine in Paris; the restless 1990s marking the emergence of women in film, video and television; the current documentary boom in the digital and post-digital ages, often with a cutting political edge. Sessions will consist of screenings, in class or at home, with short response papers as follow-ups. In addition, we will discuss secondary readings that address a host of issues such as, among others: the environmental footprint of colonialism, as can be gleaned from its own educational cinema and actualités (newsreels);  the high nonfictional content of fictional features in the “pioneer” films of Sembene, Hondo, Ganda, etc; the contested “documentary value” of historical genres such as the biopic and the epic; the close correlation between genre aesthetics and gender politics; epistemologies of the visual counter-archive: the uses of visual media, new and old, to mount challenges against long standing misrepresentations about the “real” in societies that remain “under Western eyes” and, more often than not, are passive consumers rather than producers of their own images; the status of the performative in mixed genres (domestic ethnography, web-i-docs, mockumentaries); postcolonial francophone documentary as an ethics of care and transcultural cinematic empathy.

GeneralEds: [],
Description: "IIn this course, we will examine representations of the sacred and the profane in French literature and culture from the early modern period through to the present. We will consider the sacred and religious dimensions of pre-modern French society via iconic figures including Joan of Arc; the medieval coronation ceremony (sacre des rois); the carnaval; and texts on demonology, witchcraft, and spirit possession. We will then explore the connections between Enlightenment rationality and materialism and the so-called “Super-Enlightenment” in which many leading eighteenth-century figures also dabbled: alchemy, arcana and the occult, the secret societies (Freemasons and Illuminati) accused of plotting the Revolution, and mysticism and speculative metaphysics. In the 19th century we will explore themes of transcendence, profanation, and excess in decadent poetry and the literature of the fantastique, and read texts on drugs (opium and hashish), and their relationship to dreams and the unconscious. Finally, we will explore secularization in contemporary France, the revolutionary history and specificity of French laïcité and its relationship to the “religions du Livre” (Judaism, Christianity and Islam), and French anxieties about the loss of transcendence and the retreat of religion from national and civic life, and its simultaneous return in the form of the religion of the ‘other.’  Prerequisite: French 306",

These themes include: human population growth, consumption, biodiversity, climate change, and environmental health. We will be trying on a number of theoretical lenses from geography's broad human-environment tradition (such as physical geography, cultural ecology, commodity chain analysis, political ecology, resource geography, the human dimensions of global change, hazards geography and environmental justice). In other words, I not only want us to explore a range of environmental issues, but also to grapple with theory and how this informs our understanding of the human-environment interface.",

For each of these hazard types, we apply theoretical concepts from major hazards research paradigms, including quantifying the human and economic impacts of disaster; assessing, managing, and mitigating risk; and reducing the impacts of disaster, not only through engineering works but also by reducing social vulnerability and enhancing adaptive capacity. Looking into the future, we will discuss how global-scale processes, such as climate change and globalization, might affect the frequency, intensity, and geographical distribution of environmental hazards in the decades to come.",

And yet every year, hundreds of millions of people continue to move into cities to pursue a better future. The contemporary social, economic, and political changes are intrinsically linked to divergent urban processes across the world. This paramount shift poses important theoretical and empirical questions to our age. This course uses the critical perspective of 'global urbanism' to both contextualize and connect different urban experiences across places. We will introduce various urban settings and demonstrate how complex relations between urbanization, globalization, and economic development produce spatial unevenness and social inequality. We will study the dominant paradigm of world and global cities, which prioritizes development trajectories of cities in the global North, and discuss contesting views focusing on 'ordinary cities' from the global South. Drawing on case studies in the developed and less-developed world, we will also learn how to apply the relational comparative urbanism approach as well as regionally based theoretical perspectives to comprehend the diverse urban landscapes around the globe.",

Departments: ["Geography"],
DistributionReq: "",
GeneralEds: [],
Description: "Migration, and more broadly, (im)mobilities literatures challenge us to connect broad scale migration flows with local places and construct from these linkages a notion of “home”.  Home is intimately connected to place and broadly conceptualized environments.   In this course we will engage with and draw upon several overlapping literatures grounded in inter-disciplinary perspectives offered in migration studies.  Course topics may include migration, diaspora, home, environment and environmental change, identity, place, belonging, as well as material expressions of these ideas, including art, architecture, symbolic places and monuments.  Through an exploration of case studies both here in the Twin Cities as well as those drawn from around the world, this course offers an introduction to the basic principles and theories of migration and the ways in which migrants shape and transform place and are in turn shaped and transformed by their experience of place and home.   Migration challenges us to consider different conceptualizations of home, belonging and identity.  As such, this course offers an introduction to these concepts through discussion, field excursions and student-designed projects.",

Remote sensing is the science of acquiring data using measurements of electromagnetic radiation by techniques that do not require actual contact with the object or area being observed. The different sensors used to collect this information and the interpretation techniques vary quite widely and are being developed at an astounding rate. In this course, the focus is on the interpretation and applications of data from spaceborne imaging systems (e.g. Landsat MMS, Landsat TM, ETM+, MODIS, Sentinel-2). Students will learn the fundamentals of remote sensing through the use of problem solving and spatial thinking skills. The number of disciplines which utilize remotely sensed data continues to increase. Geologists, geographers, climatologists, and ecologists have all adapted remote sensing techniques to their respective research. This course will discuss many different uses of remotely sensed data, with a focus on environmental and ecological applications. Laboratory work is required.

Description: "In this urban studies capstone seminar students research the internal and external forces that will foster change and reinforce the status quo in American metropolitan areas during the 21st century. Course readings focus on suburbs, which are the dominant mode of metropolitan living in contemporary America. We will consider the history of suburbanization, the political economy of growth in the suburbs, the rise of smart growth strategies, and other attempts to foster change in the suburban experience (including the New Urbanism, green building and green movements, and regionalism). We will also consider how suburbs are now experiencing demographic changes and investigate the struggle for community in historic and contemporary suburbs. This seminar will thus complicate the conventional narrative of suburbs as sprawling, inauthentic and homogeneous places. Students will further enrich their understanding of issues covered in the course by conducting original research that examines ways in which American suburbs are changing and/or remaining the same despite efforts to the contrary. Students will consider their collective findings and discuss what they portend for American cities in the 21st century.",

Whether they are big-budget thrillers like Jurassic Park, San Andreas, or The Day After Tomorrow, or low-brow science fiction like Boa, movies tend to stretch the reality of natural hazards and earth processes to great dramatic effect. In this course, we will have the opportunity to watch a variety of movie clips that focus on geologic hazards (such as volcanoes, earthquakes, avalanches, floods, and tsunamis) and other earth processes (origins of life, evolution, mass extinction, climate change, and glaciers). We will examine the scientific features and processes depicted in films, learn about their scientific basis, and critique the film's portrayal of earth process. Students will work in groups to examine a film centered on a geological process, and critique the way science is depicted. The final project gives you the opportunity to develop your own script for a movie that does the geology correctly. This course will cover quantitative concepts relevant to earth processes, such as describing the world quantitatively, understanding uncertainty and risk, and evaluating quality and sources of data.",

We will be examining the processes that turn solid rock into transportable material, the transport mechanisms themselves (whether beneath glaciers, down hillslopes, or in rivers), and the patterns of deposition, many of which are unique to the processes that created them. These processes range from the very large (volcanism and mountain-building) to the microscopic (frost cracking of rock, soil creep, and chemical weathering along mineralogic grain boundaries). Some processes occur frequently across geographic boundaries and throughout geologic time (like rainsplash), while others are stochastic in nature and dramatic in their geomorphic signature (like glacial outburst floods). We will focus on the roles of rivers, glaciers, and mass movements in shaping landscapes, but will examine wide-ranging landscapes such as arid environments and coastal regions. The study of current surface processes on the Earth will be examined with an eye toward understanding the evolution of landscapes over geologic timescales.

Vampires have always been popular fodder and will continue to be so, even if and as the image of the vampire shifts dramatically over time. The popularity of vampires has waxed and waned for over a hundred years, partially because vampirism can be used as a metaphor for almost anything-from the plague to sexuality to addiction. We will juxtapose classic tales of vampires as monsters with the more recent generation of vampires. What happened to change our imagination of vampires from monsters into hip, outsider superheroes? And what can the examination of vampires tell us about the context in which they were created?",

In this course, we will explore the porous boundary between the human and the parahuman in literature, film, and popular culture. Robots and androids, puppets and marionettes, living statues and Doppelgänger, prosthetic devices from artificial limbs to canes and eyeglasses are just some of the phenomena that inhabit and traverse the border between wo/man and machine, the natural and the artificial. How does culture figure the border between the human and its others? How does this border shift through history? How are parahumans gendered? How natural and how artificial is gender? Texts by Goethe, E.T.A. Hoffmann, Tieck, and Heine; films and television series by Fritz Lang, Rainer Maria Fassbinder, and others.

Departments: ["History"],

GeneralEds: ['Writing WA', 'U.S. Identities and Differences'],
Description: "In the Plan of Union prepared during the 1754 'Albany Convention,' Anglo-American colonists met to consider uniting as a loose confederation for their common defense and to ally with the Iroquois confederacy. That plan failed, but a later experiment in unity succeeded when the united colonies declared independence. Nevertheless, social, cultural, and ideological differences persisted, and the union formed in 1776 was tried and tested before finally fracturing with the secession of South Carolina, precipitating the Civil War. In the intervening years, Americans grappled with how they should govern themselves, who should be included in the polity, and how society should be organized. Reformers considered the controversial issues of women's rights, the role of Native Americans within the US, and the place of slavery in a nation founded on the precept that 'All men are created equal.' This course covers the periods of the French and Indian War, the American Revolution, the early national and antebellum periods, before concluding with the Civil War. It also considers the global causes and consequences of the war and the rise of the new United States. We will also analyze the construction of the myth and historical memory of Alexander Hamilton, the founding father who has captured the imagination of people in the modern U.S.  Through a study of the recent biography of Hamilton along with the music and stage production of Hamilton, we will consider both the biographical and mythical Alexander Hamilton in order to understand his era and our own. Can count towards 'Colonization and Empire,' or 'Race and Indigeneity,' or 'Law and Social Justice,' or 'North America' fields.",

The historical voices and perspectives of childhood that we study will pay close attention to the significance of race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality, time periods, and social settings. Some questions we will consider relevant to the study of history: Do children have agency? What is the role of children as subjects in history? How has childhood been socially and historically constructed? Why are children such galvanizing social and political symbols? From the Revolutionary era & slavery to immigration, education, and society up to the current day, this course will examine how the social construction of gender, race & class formed concepts of childhood culturally, socially, and politically. How is identity shaped in childhood and what impact does this have on society at certain historical moments?",

GeneralEds: ['Writing WA', 'U.S. Identities and Differences'],
Description: "The history of American Indians is wonderfully complex, but this history is simultaneously fraught with misconceptions and misinterpretations. European (and, later, Euro-Americans) alternated among fascination, fear, and frustration toward American Indians, while American Indians sought to maintain tribal sovereignty and control over their lands, cultures, religions, politics, and lifestyles amidst continuing encroachment and settlement. This course examines American Indian history to 1871 - the year that Congress stopped making treaties with Native nations - by considering the complicated and multifaceted history of the nation's indigenous people. By looking at American Indian interactions with Spanish, French, British, and American explorers, settlers, missionaries, militaries, and government officials, this courses argues that the history of American Indians is essential to understanding past as well as present issues. Furthermore, this course looks to move beyond the notion that American Indian history is one of inevitable decline by creating a more nuanced understanding of the American Indian experience from pre-contact toward the twentieth century.",

This course explores the way that questions of health have shaped the African continent from the period of European colonization in the early twentieth century to today. We will explore topics such as the development of colonial public health infrastructure, the emergence of international health and development institutions during the period of African decolonization, and the continuing challenges that independent states in Africa today face dealing with both epidemic disease and preventative care. We will focus on a wide variety of public health issues, including insect-borne diseases like malaria and sleeping sickness, AIDS, cancer, malnourishment and malnutrition, infant and maternal health care, and Ebola. This course will give students a historical as well as a contemporary perspective on public health in African society and politics. In addition to our readings of leading scholars in this field, we will engage with historical documents, literature, and film.

Departments: ["International Studies"],
DistributionReq: "Social science",
GeneralEds: [],
Description: "Globalization is upon us, resulting in unprecedented cultural interpenetration and civilizational encounter. Most of what animates this condition is old. However, the contemporary velocity, reach, and mutations of these forces suggest a new 'world time,' full of contradictions, perils, and promises. This course introduces students to globalization by asking What is globalization, and how does one study it? What are the principal forces (social groups, ideas, institutions, and ecological circumstances) that shaped and now propel it? What are its concrete consequences, and how are we to respond? Open to first- and second-year students, or permission of the instructor.",

GeneralEds: [],
Description: "One of the most significant trends of the current era has been globalization: the shrinking of distances, the greater interpenetration of the world's peoples, and the rise, perhaps, of a so-called global culture. Yet it is too simple to say, 'it's all a big mix,' for the questions of how the mixing is done, and who mixes, are complex. The study of literature illuminates these questions. By reading important recent texts, this course tackles 'world' questions: what does it mean to be from a certain place? what is a culture? and who are we in it? We'll work to link our own personal readings with the texts in dialogue with the world. Texts will be drawn from U.S. multicultural, 'world,' and travel literature, and rich theoretical readings. Open to first- and second-year students, or permission of the instructor. Prerequisite(s): Open only to First Year students and rising sophomores.",

Description: "Tropical ecosystems provide critical services both locally and globally including water sources, climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation. They are also home to various human populations and support livelihoods. This course offers an introduction to the human-environment landscapes of the New World tropics from a geographical perspective. The course is designed to provide students a basic understanding of the most important biophysical and social characteristics of the dominant landscapes of the New World tropics. Among others, these include the tropical rain forests of the Amazon basin, the montane forests and páramos of the Andes, and the tropical dry forests of the Pacific coast of South America. For each of these environments, we will learn the key biogeographical and ecological processes that make these ecosystems function the way they do. We will also study the peoples that live in these environments—indigenous communities, afro-descendants, and mestizo populations—and how they interact with their environment. Finally, we will cover some of the threats that these places face, including deforestation, afforestation, and climate change.",

Description: "The aim of this course is to make you aware of the complex organization and systematic nature of language, the primary means of human communication. In a sense, you will be studying yourself, since you are a prime example of a language user. Most of your knowledge of language, however, is unconscious, and the part of language that you can describe is largely the result of your earlier education, which may have given you confused, confusing, or misleading notions about language. This course is intended to clarify your ideas about language and bring you to a better understanding of its nature. By the end of the course you should be familiar with some of the terminology and techniques of linguistic analysis and be able to apply this knowledge to the description of different languages. There are no prerequisites, but this course is the prerequisite for almost every higher level course within the linguistics major.",

Description: "Nearly all natural languages are spoken. Biological properties of the human ear, pharynx, larynx, tongue, and lung impose limits on the sounds of human languages, which can be studied from both a biological and an acoustic point of view. In this course you will be trained to produce and recognize (almost) all the sounds which human languages make use of, and to develop a systematic way of analyzing and recording them. Since sounds are perceived as well as produced, you will also be introduced to the acoustic analysis of speech, learning how acoustic signals of frequency, amplitude, and duration are translated into visible, quantifiable images. You will learn the art of decoding these spectrograms into sounds and words and sentences. The linguistics laboratory contains several different programs for practicing and listening to sounds from many of the world's languages. This course is recommended for students of foreign languages, drama, music and anyone who wants to become more aware of their (and other people's) pronunciation.",

Description: "Although all humans are born with the capacity to learn the sounds of any language, part of learning our native language is learning to categorize sounds into groups specific to that language, thereby filtering out many of the actual phonetic distinctions and concentrating only on those that are important. Just as we, as English speakers, may have trouble hearing the difference between the voiced and voiceless click consonants in Zulu, so speakers of other languages may not hear the difference between the vowels in 'beat' and 'bit,' because this small distinction isn't important in their language. Phonology is the study of how different languages organize sounds into perceptual categories. In this class we will look at data from a wide variety of different languages, as well as from several dialects of English, including children's acquisition of a phonological system. Emphasis will be on practical skills in solving problem sets. Prerequisite(s): LING 100 or LING 104 .",

Its aesthetic approach isolates the features that constitute film as a distinct art form: narrative or non-narrative structure, staging, cinematography, editing, and sound. Topics in contemporary film studies that might be considered include one or more of the following: cultural studies and film, industrial organization and globalization, representations of gender and race, and theories of authorship, horror, and spectatorship. Several papers, a test covering basic film terms, and a short video project emphasizing abstract form are required. Suitable for first year students.",

Departments: ["Media and Cultural Studies"],
DistributionReq: "",
GeneralEds: [],
Description: "Geologists tell us that we have entered a new epoch called the Anthropocene, when humans have fundamentally reshaped the planet in ways that put the future of life at risk. This course will consider questions like: When did the Anthropocene begin? Who has the power to define an epoch? How have we represented environmental disasters in the past and present? What are the stories we tell ourselves about human’s relationship to the Earth? Where do we find hope for our futures? A timely look at the concept of “The Anthropocene” provides us with special opportunities for self-reflection, debate and expression. Our fiction and non-fiction readings, film screenings and experiential learning will help us answer if there could be such a thing as a “good” Anthropocene rather than simply an apocalyptic one. We will develop our writing and research skills working on collaborative projects with the Twin Cities as our backdrop. This interdisciplinary course is being co-taught by faculty from three different departments: Andrea Kaston Tange (English), John Kim (Media and Cultural Studies) and Roopali Phadke (Environmental Studies).  Students can select which section to join, but all sections will cover the same material and meet at the same time. Students will spend time in their individual section, have opportunities to work with the other two professors, occasionally meet up in one large group that includes all three sections, and take local and regional field trips together.",

Description: "This course is designed as a basic introduction to digital video production. The objective of the class is to familiarize students of film theory and history with the language of cinema from the standpoint of production in order to deepen your appreciation and knowledge of the technical aspects of film/video and to develop your capacity to use video as a tool for research and communication. In this way, the course will be a combination of technical instruction, critical engagement, and creative exploration. We will analyze and employ a variety of filmmaking techniques as well as constructing narrative and non-narrative strategies for doing so. The focus of the course will be to familiarize you with some basic conventions of experimental, documentary, and narrative cinema. In each assignment, you will be encouraged to think about how formal decisions enhance and further narrative or thematic elements. We will thus pay very close attention to formal aspects of cinematic production: mise-en-scene. cinematography, editing, and sound design. In addition to this attention to form, success in the class will be dependent on a commitment to working through the technical aspects of video production (camera operation, lighting, editing software) in order to create short, original video pieces. Prerequisite(s): MCST 128 or MCST 248 or MCST 249 .",

How have relationships of class, gender, ethnicity, and sexuality been linked to 'race'? How has 'race' been a site of struggle between groups? How is the present a product of historical experiences?

Description: "This course focuses on the dialogue and mutual influence between the German- and French-speaking traditions of political economy and philosophical and theoretical thought, as it becomes evident in the relations among German Idealism, Phenomenology, Existentialism, Psychoanalysis, (post-)Structuralism, and their productive interconnections in the development of Critical Theory. While becoming familiar with the work of Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Jacque Lacan, as well as the work of relevant thinkers who influenced their thought, we shall be examining the structural and conceptual homologies and differences among political economy, abstract thought, and human subjectivity. The last part of the course will focus on the relation between these interconnections (among economy, ideas, culture, and the constitution of identities) and the exercise of power in the era of global capitalism, as theorized by thinkers who draw on this German-French-speaking line of thought.  This is a core course toward the Critical Theory concentration; all readings and class taught in English; no pre-knowledge required. Students may take this offering for credit even if they took the same course Fall 2018; the material is different.",

GeneralEds: [],
Description: "From E. M. Forster's Lucy Honeychurch, who 'entered into a more solid world when she opened the piano,' to James Baldwin's Sonny, who 'moved in an atmosphere which wasn't like theirs at all,' fictional musicians encounter trouble when negotiating the conflicting realms of art and society. Experts in one kind of expression, they fail in others. What draws these characters to music? What does it offer them? What is its value to us? In the musical novel and short story, we encounter music as an agent of violence, of consolation, of transcendence and redemption as well as damnation. We witness empathy through music, but we also learn that shared feeling can be both beautiful and dangerous, that music unites and divides. This course combines the close reading of literary texts (as well as works of literary theory and musicology) with the examination of the musical contexts that inform and inspire them. We will explore, for example, the relationship between Kazuo Ishiguro's novel The Unconsoled and Richard Wagner's music drama Parsifal. We will talk about syncopation in 'jazz' by Charles Mingus and Toni Morrison. We will watch Marguerite Duras and Katherine Mansfield turn innocuous music lessons into spaces of wretchedness. We will try to understand what David Mitchell's young composer Robert Frobisher means when he says, 'One writes music because winter is eternal and because, if one didn't, the wolves and blizzards would be at one's throat all the sooner.'",

This course introduces Uyghur culture, language, literature, religion, and art from both historical and ethnographic perspectives. Course materials address topics such as minority nationalism, representation, Islamophobia, mass incarceration, and contested histories, while also taking a critical look at discourses of pluralism, terrorism, and the “Silk Road.” Music and performing arts are highly valued in Uyghur societies and often venues where identities are performed. We will listen closely to major genres of traditional and modern Uyghur music, and be involved in a small-scale performance of an early modern Uyghur drama.

Description: "This course traces the development of Western art music from its beginnings in the monophonic chant of early Christianity, through the development of polyphonic genres in the Renaissance (mass, motet, madrigal), to the emergence of opera in Italy around 1600 and the stylistic revolution that we now call the Baroque (including musical life in the extravagant court of Louis XIV in France and Johann Sebastian Bach's masterful synthesis of Baroque styles), to the sophisticated, multi-movement sonata structures of late 18th century Viennese classicism. Its central concerns are: (1) to understand the place of music in social and cultural life, (2) to gain an appreciation of the musical style and rhetoric that characterizes each of the periods we study, and (3) to develop students' abilities in communicating, in writing and the spoken word, what they have learned about this music and the culture in which it was produced. Course activities will take several forms, including lectures, musical analyses, and performances. Lectures will introduce key terms and concepts and will address broader concerns of cultural life (including composer biographies). In-class analysis and performance will lead to a more detailed understanding of key works. Examinations will test students' retention of course listening and lecture/discussion/reading material. Essays will give students the opportunity to delve deeper into critical and musical analysis, and to sharpen their prose, specifically with respect to writing about music. The course assumes no historical knowledge of the periods in question. However, basic skills in the analysis of music are necessary. Prerequisite(s): MUSI 113 or permission of instructor.",

We will start by considering debates over freedom of speech, privacy, surveillance, and intellectual property: issues that pre-exist the development of the Internet, but which because of it have taken on new dimensions. From here we will go on to take up some ethical questions arising from four different domains of activity on the social web: gaming, social networking, blog/wiki developing, and 'hacktivism.' In the third part of the course, we will consider broad questions connected to the integration of the Internet with devices other than the personal computer and mobile phone and which open the prospect of a world of integrated networked systems. What are some of the impacts of such integration on our everyday ethical relations with others and on the overall quality of our lives? How does being networked affect the meaning of being human?",

Description: "'Spirit is bone,' wrote Hegel, exploding traditional logic and by extension the way we think about ethics, politics, and society. Hegel's discovery that consciousness is an historical artifact cleared the way for neo-Marxist social theory (Adorno), feminism (Beauvoir, Irigaray), constructivist gender theory (Butler), to mention just a few who moved in the 'wake of Hegel.' In this course, after familiarizing ourselves with relevant issues in Kant (Hegel's main foil), we will work through Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit with an eye to its significance for issues of critical and social theory. Discussion topics include: 'human nature' as a product of history; narrative as a way of 'doing' philosophy; the master-slave dialectic; how an historical event like the French Revolution is part of 'philosophy'; gender theory and Hegel's reading of Sophocles' 'Antigone.' No prerequisites except a willingness to work through densely argued texts. Weekly reading responses, 3 mid-length papers.",

What limits should a society place on its citizens' behaviors? What freedoms should a society allow? Because these are questions over which reasonable people may disagree, coming up with mutually agreeable answers requires extensive public discussion and debate. The citizen who can discover reliable evidence, make sound arguments, and reason well in the face of strong counter-arguments also embodies the very notion of a liberally educated person. Students will develop their argumentation skills by focusing on congressional debates that have powerfully shaped the United States, including slavery, Indian removal, woman's rights, war powers, and impeachment.

Description: "This course has three broad goals. The first is to develop the foundational knowledge and conceptual literacy necessary to engage with International Relations' multidimensional concerns. These include issues such as world order, power, hierarchy, political violence, international law, development, religion, human rights, gender, humanitarianism and international organizations (such as the United Nations). The second is to introduce students to the different perspectives or intellectual frameworks for making sense of international relations (also known as global or world politics), including realist, liberal, constructivist, historical materialist, postcolonial and feminist approaches. The third is to encourage students to reflect on some of the ethical issues inherent in both the study and practice of international politics. Emphasis will also be placed on developing a range of critical, analytical, research and writing skills required for the further study of international politics. The course is thus intended to prepare students for advanced work in the field, although it is also appropriate for those merely seeking to satisfy an interest in the study of global politics.",

Description: "In Comparative Politics we use comparison to analyze political outcomes within and across countries, Why do Mexican presidents exercise strong centralized authority while Brazilian presidents must contend with powerful governors? Why do Muslims and Hindus fight in some Indian states but not in others? Why does Rwanda have such a high proportion of female legislators whereas the U.S. has such a low proportion? When confronted with large-scale protests in their cities, do state security forces in China, Russia, and the United States respond with similar methods or do they differ? Through comparative analysis, students will learn to describe diverse political institutions, to propose explanations for divergent outcomes, and to evaluate scholarly and popular arguments about politics.",

The relationships among work, wealth and well-being are a perennial concern and have been central to the study of political economy, since its inception in the mid- to late-18th century. How does work produce wealth for the individual and for society? How, or when, does individual and social wealth translate into individual and/or social well-being? And, how does the character of work affect individual well-being or happiness? This course will examine the answers given to these questions (and myriad corollary questions) by writers within the political economy tradition.",

Title: "Medieval Political Thought",
Departments: ["Political Science"],
DistributionReq: "Social science",
GeneralEds: [],
Description: "This course deals with the political thought of Latin Christendom (Western Europe) during the later Middle Ages (c. 1050 - c. 1550). This body of thought is worthy of sustained study for two reasons. First, it is one of the glories of human civilization. In seeking to answer the timeless question 'how we should live our lives as individuals' and 'how we should live together in peace and justice' late medieval political thinkers produced a body of political thought second to none in the history of human philosophical speculation. Second, late medieval political thought is worthy of study because it gave rise to many of the concepts that continue to shape our collective lives today (including state sovereignty, separation of church and state, constitutionalism, just war, property rights, 'the people,' nationalism, democracy, rule-of-law, and human rights). Indeed, it is impossible to really understand contemporary political life without delving deeply into the way in which late medieval thinkers engaged with the big political issues of their day. The main goal of this course is to provide a solid introduction to the political thought of this crucially important era in human history. In it, we will critically examine the relevant works of thinkers such as St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, John of Paris, Marsilius of Padua, Bartolus of Sasseferato, and Baldus de Ubaldi. To the extent that they shed light on late medieval thought, we will also touch on classical political theorists such as Aristotle and Cicero as well as Muslim and Jewish thinkers such as ibn Sina, Moshe ben Maimon, and ibn Rusd.",

Departments: ["Environmental Studies", "German Studies", "Political Science"],

GeneralEds: [],
Description: "Spinoza (1632-1677) has been called the “savage anomaly” of the Enlightenment because his philosophy enables an alternative or ‘hidden’ modernity based on the interdependence of beings rather than their hierarchy. Ever more political theorists, environmentalists, and ecologists are turning to Spinoza’s vision of a nonhierarchical union of nature and society that rejects anthropocentrism as the promise for a more equitable and sustainable life. In this course we shall focus on the foundation of Spinoza’s unconventional thesis: his intertwined conceptions of the human being as part of nature—as opposed to the prevailing notion of the human as an autonomous “imperium” in, yet above, nature—and of society as a continuation of nature—as opposed to the dominant theories of the “social contract” that ground society on its break with, or repression of, nature (Grotius, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Kant). We shall examine Spinoza’s entailed radical revision in understanding both the “political” and the “environment.” Beyond Spinoza’s Ethics and his Theologico-Political and Political treatises, we shall read major commentators both on Spinoza’s ethical and political theory—e.g., Louis Althusser, Étienne Balibar, Edwin Curley, Gilles Deleuze, Michael Hardt, Pierre Macherey, Warren Montag, Antonio Negri—and on his role in environmental ethics and Deep Ecology—e.g., Bill Devall, Leslie Le Grange, K.L.F. Houle, Gal Kober, Genevieve Lloyd, Beth Lord, Arne Naess, Georg Sessions, Oli Stephano, Margaret Dauler Wilson.

We will study this tradition through musical, literary, theological, and political lenses, dividing the course into two acts. Act One traces the form's development from liturgical chant up to the paradigmatic settings of Johann Sebastian Bach. Act Two considers modern adaptations of the Passion tradition, which interrogate issues of political ideology, class, race, gender, queerness, and more. The specter of anti-Judaism will be discussed at length. The course requires no prerequisites, though a familiarity with Western musical notation is necessary and will be assumed.",

Description: "Dostoevsky lived an extraordinary life. After achieving instant fame with the publication of Poor Folk, he languished in near obscurity for many years. He was sentenced to death for participation in a political society and was reprieved by the tsar just minutes before his scheduled execution. He served four years of hard labor in prison and another five years in exile in Siberia. He suffered from debilitating epilepsy and a compulsive gambling habit, and he struggled with massive debt. Yet by the end of his life the Russian public hailed him as a prophet and Russia's greatest living writer. Like his life, his novels are extraordinary. They plumb the dark depths of the human soul, confronting the reader with issues of life and death, good and evil, and the presence of evil in God's universe.

Description: "The course introduces students to the sociological imagination, or 'the quality of mind essential to grasp the interplay of individual and society, of biography and history, of self and the world,' as C. Wright Mills described it. The enduring value of a sociological imagination is to help students situate peoples' lives and important events in broader social contexts by understanding how political, economic, and cultural forces constitute social life. Sociology explores minute aspects of social life (microsociology) as well as global social processes and structures (macrosociology). Topics covered vary from semester to semester, but may include: socialization, suburbanization and housing, culture, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class stratification, deviance and crime, economic and global inequality, families and intimate relationships, education, religion, and globalization.",

Description: "The use of imprisonment as a form of criminal punishment is only about as old at the United States. Currently, 1 in 100 adults in the United States are in prison or jail. How should we understand the growth of this form of criminal punishment? How is it similar to other methods to react to and to attempt to control unwanted behavior? What are the social consequences of these formal institutions of social control? In this course, we examine these developments in the processes and organization of social control, paying particular attention to criminal behavior and formal, legal responses to crime. We study and evaluate sociological theories of criminal behavior to understand how social forces influence levels of crimes. We examine recent criminal justice policies in the United States and their connections to inequality, examining the processes that account for expanding criminalization. Finally, we compare the development of formal, bureaucratic systems of social control and informal methods of social control, paying attention to the social and political implications of these developments.",

We will question taken-for-granted assumptions about the child as we explore how understandings, representations, and experiences of childhood vary across historical, cultural, and geographical contexts. Examining the significance of race and ethnicity, social class, gender, gender identity, sexuality, and disability within children’s lives, we will consider the diverse experiences of childhood. Core themes include the social construction of childhood, children’s agency, and debates surrounding children’s rights in a global context. We will discuss contemporary research on how, why, and with what consequences the transition to adulthood has become stratified, scrambled, or only partially realized because of systems of oppression and privilege that shape people’s opportunities in higher education, paid work, partnering, parenting, and living independently. Assignments will encourage students to bring a critical perspective to images and narratives of childhood.",

Both historical and transatlantic in scope, the course focuses on issues such as poverty, slavery, class conflict, gender and ethnic discrimination, and migration in a variety of texts ranging from the 16th to the 21st century. The list of marginalized and subaltern subjects that we will examine includes, but is not limited to, the rogue or pícaro, the slave, the prostitute, the abused spouse, the homosexual, and the immigrant. While its thematic content will appeal to a myriad of students, the course aims both at refining textual analysis and providing a comprehensive view of the evolution of Hispanic fiction. It is thus particularly targeted at those who enjoy literature and believe in the pleasure of the text. The course will require short written essays and a longer, more formal, end-of-term paper that must make use of appropriate bibliographical sources. All sessions and course materials will be in English. Both the professor and the students will determine topics of discussion according to their own interests.",

Description: "Living an identity that is multipositional is a familiar reality for many people in the 21st century. The seventeenth century Hispanic world reveals surprisingly diverse and complex societies in which literature-and sometimes life itself-provided a space for trying on different social clothes, so to speak, in an exploration of early modern identity. This course will allow students to enjoy prose, drama, poetry and historiography from both Spain and Spanish America and to witness how writers from both sides of the Atlantic were pushing aesthetic and societal limits of religion, ethnicity and gender in their writing. We view Baroque art from Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, and colonial Mexico and Peru, and read some pertinent critical perspectives that will help enrich our readings of the literature. To bring the plays to life, students will select fragments of dramas to 'rescript' and perform for their classmates. This course satisfies the Area 1 requirement for the Spanish major.

Description: "The course offers a panorama of Hispanic culture from the nineteenth century to the Spanish Civil War. It centers on the literature and the arts during the periods of the Enlightenment, Romanticism, Realism, and the Avant-Garde. The period from 1800 to 1936 is crucial to the development of art. We will examine critical issues such as the limits of authority and the freedom of choice; the origins of modern subjectivity/ the pursuit of the ideal and the impossible; the conflict between individualism and nationalism, and that between empire and colonies; the rise of the bourgeoisie and the transition to a secular world; the crisis of reason; and the autonomy of art. Our goal will be to shed light on the Janus-faced mingling of progress with tradition that defines modernity in the Hispanic world. to this end, we will deal with the social, cultural, aesthetic and political dimensions that shape the evolution of literature and the arts during the 19th- and the first half of the 20th- centuries.

In many studies, the outcome of interest is the time between between events (e.g. onset of Alzheimer's until death, time unlit default on a loan, unemployment duration, marriage duration, removal-­to-­recurrence of a tumor, emergency room length of stay). Survival analysis evolved from a practical reality: the precise values of data are often unknown. We will introduce the concepts of censoring and truncation, and discuss the Kaplan-­Meier curve, parametric regression models, Cox's proportional hazards model, and time-­varying covariates. The course will have an applied focus. Examples may be drawn from a variety of fields including, but not restricted to, medicine, economics, sociology, and political science.

Description: "The study of anatomy and somatics provide concrete pathways to deepening our understanding of self and the mind-body connection. We will study the musculoskeletal human anatomy on both a theoretical and practical level. Countering the notion that the body is an assemblage parts to be trained, strengthened, and disciplined, we will delve into various mind-body practices that illuminate anatomy from a first-person perspective. We will focus on experiential learning including embodied anatomy and movement practices that provide direct knowledge of anatomy and alignment while providing opportunities for an integrated experience from within and increased self-awareness. In-class work will be supplemented by readings, journaling, physical practice, writing and research.",

DistributionReq: "Humanities",
GeneralEds: [],
Description: "This course will address issues of gender, race, and the nation-state before and during our global crisis. It brings together discourses that have remained somewhat parallel and unrelated–Whiteness Studies and Postcolonial Studies.  It is based on the premise that ‘whiteness’ as an academic/social framework stems from and is intertwined with social and political identity-based movements (feminist, critical race, etc.).  In other words, studies of the intersection of gender, race, class, and nation initiated in the post-colonizing imagination seeks to shake up paradigms of power, and whiteness studies shares in this effort.  This course explores where and how the notion of ‘whiteness’ converges and diverges from post-colonialism.  Prerequisite(s): Sophomore or junior standing, or permission of instructor; one introductory core or cross-listed course in the department recommended. Every other year.",

Departments: ["Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies"],
DistributionReq: "Social science",
GeneralEds: [],
Description: "From Caitlyn Jenner to Laverne Cox, CeCe MacDonald to Chelsea Manning, trans people are experiencing unprecedented media coverage. In fact, Time Magazine declared in 2014 that we are at the “transgender tipping point.” And yet, alongside this positive media coverage, we see legislatures across the country debated so-called “bathroom bills” that foment fear of the transsexual child predator, bills that would limit or criminalize gender-affirming medical care, as well as bills seeking to define sex in order to prevent trans athletes from participating in school and collegiate sports. In all of these instances, it’s useful to consider how and why the specter of transness is raised. What social and political work does that figure do? This course will examine transness as a practice of gender transgression, rather than solely an identity category, one which is historically and geographically contingent. In doing so, we will ask: What is trans? How do race, class, gender, sexuality, and disability structure trans lives and communities? How have key institutions within the US constructed ideas about gender normativity and policed gender transgression? How has that policing impacted and shaped trans life? What is the relationship between feminism and trans people and trans liberation? How have trans people envisioned and fought for social justice? What space can trans open up for new ways of living, relating, and imagining otherwise? Prerequisite: Any previous WGSS course or permission of instructor.",

Description: "We are living in revolutionary times. This course takes a journey through the last 50 years of some large upheavals across the world-in bio-regimes, language, politics, economics, culture, and media-to find some answers of how we are similar and different.  It uncovers how and why the struggles, in theories and practices, for power and representation have created the conditions in which we exist today. We travel through all kinds of ‘post’ and ‘neo’-liberalism, humanism, feminism, nationalism, and colonialism-and how they intertwine in our own lived experiences.  Some topics: protest against gender, sexual, race, economic, and linguistic bio-regimes, revolts of the colonized and marginalized, and resistant/ liberatory creations in art, technology, and media. Authors include Linda Tuhiwai Smith, Michel Foucault, Theresa Cha, Silvia Federici, Noam Chomsky, Ta-Nehisi Coates, bell hooks, Chela Sandoval, and Gayatri Spivak, among others.
