It has roots in Buddhism, however, most religious traditions practice some form of meditation or prayer which helps to gain a broader perspective on life and an appreciation of the present.  A rapidly growing body of scientific evidence supports the findings that meditation can have a profound effect on our health and well-being, often through stress reduction.  The practice of mindfulness meditation emerged into mainstream medicine, in part, through the efforts of Professor emeritus Jon Kabat-Zinn, who is the founder and former director of the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center.   MBSR techniques and training are now used in many clinical and academic settings, including Macalester College.    MBSR and other meditation techniques have been shown to have a profound effect on reducing stress, lowering blood pressure, reducing chronic pain and more.  In this class, we will read and discuss research articles on the “science of mindfulness” and how mindfulness practices impact our health and well-being.   You will also be writing a multi-draft review paper on a related topic and presenting your findings to the class.   One of my main goals for this class is to reduce stress and promote individual health, developing practices for now and future present moments.  For this reason, I will ask students to commit to a daily of practice of mindfulness.  Training in these practices will be part of the class.

We will discover how popular culture not only entertains, but is also a site where meanings are produced, shared, and contested.

The course consists of three interlocking objectives. The first goal is to provide students with the opportunity to develop an original research project that reflects their deepest aesthetic interests and ethical commitments. Working closely with a faculty member and a small group of peers, students will develop projects that display rigorous literary scholarship and methodological inventiveness. The second goal is to provide instruction in advanced methods of research by studying influential critical approaches from the early twentieth century to the present. Specific theories and methods will be determined in consultation with the instructor. Past courses have emphasized psychoanalysis, post-Marxist criticism, gender, queer, and feminist theory, phenomenology, critical race theory, black feminist theory, post-colonial criticism, poetics, law and human rights, and aesthetics. The final goal is to train students to become advocates of their research agenda. Students will learn to lecture and lead discussion on relevant readings and to share their research with the wider intellectual community in a form that reflects the spirit of the project. Prerequisite(s): One prior English course numbered in the 100s (excluding 101 or 150), plus one literature course at the 200- or 300- level.

Sessions will consist of screenings, in class or at home, with short response papers as follow-ups. In addition, we will discuss secondary readings that address a host of issues such as, among others: the environmental footprint of colonialism, as can be gleaned from its own educational cinema and actualités (newsreels);  the high nonfictional content of fictional features in the “pioneer” films of Sembene, Hondo, Ganda, etc; the contested “documentary value” of historical genres such as the biopic and the epic; the close correlation between genre aesthetics and gender politics; epistemologies of the visual counter-archive: the uses of visual media, new and old, to mount challenges against long standing misrepresentations about the “real” in societies that remain “under Western eyes” and, more often than not, are passive consumers rather than producers of their own images; the status of the performative in mixed genres (domestic ethnography, web-i-docs, mockumentaries); postcolonial francophone documentary as an ethics of care and transcultural cinematic empathy.

We will then explore the connections between Enlightenment rationality and materialism and the so-called “Super-Enlightenment” in which many leading eighteenth-century figures also dabbled: alchemy, arcana and the occult, the secret societies (Freemasons and Illuminati) accused of plotting the Revolution, and mysticism and speculative metaphysics. In the 19th century we will explore themes of transcendence, profanation, and excess in decadent poetry and the literature of the fantastique, and read texts on drugs (opium and hashish), and their relationship to dreams and the unconscious. Finally, we will explore secularization in contemporary France, the revolutionary history and specificity of French laïcité and its relationship to the “religions du Livre” (Judaism, Christianity and Islam), and French anxieties about the loss of transcendence and the retreat of religion from national and civic life, and its simultaneous return in the form of the religion of the ‘other.’  Prerequisite: French 306\",\n    CourseMaterials:\n      \"https://www.bkstr.com/webApp/discoverView?bookstore_id-1=1306&term_id-1=202110&div-1=&dept-1=FREN&course-1=494&section-1=01\",\n    Notes: \"*First day attendance required; taught in French*\",\n    Sections: [\n      {\n        id: \"01\",\n        Day: \"M W F\",\n        Time: [13.17, 14.17],\n        Room: \"\",\n        Instructor: \"Andrew Billing\",\n        Availability: [20, 20],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n  {\n    CourseKey: \"FREN 494-02\",\n    ClassCode: [\"FREN 494-02\"],\n    Title: \"Food in French\",\n    Departments: [\"French and Francophone Studies\"],\n    DistributionReq: \"Humanities\",\n    GeneralEds: [],\n    Description:\n      \"Varies by semester.

Along the way we'll systematically investigate major human and physical geography themes such as population dynamics and migration, agricultural change, human-environment interactions, health and disease, economic change and development, urbanization, and cultural shifts.

Some processes occur frequently across geographic boundaries and throughout geologic time (like rainsplash), while others are stochastic in nature and dramatic in their geomorphic signature (like glacial outburst floods). We will focus on the roles of rivers, glaciers, and mass movements in shaping landscapes, but will examine wide-ranging landscapes such as arid environments and coastal regions.

That plan failed, but a later experiment in unity succeeded when the united colonies declared independence. Nevertheless, social, cultural, and ideological differences persisted, and the union formed in 1776 was tried and tested before finally fracturing with the secession of South Carolina, precipitating the Civil War. In the intervening years, Americans grappled with how they should govern themselves, who should be included in the polity, and how society should be organized. Reformers considered the controversial issues of women's rights, the role of Native Americans within the US, and the place of slavery in a nation founded on the precept that 'All men are created equal.' This course covers the periods of the French and Indian War, the American Revolution, the early national and antebellum periods, before concluding with the Civil War. It also considers the global causes and consequences of the war and the rise of the new United States. We will also analyze the construction of the myth and historical memory of Alexander Hamilton, the founding father who has captured the imagination of people in the modern U.S.  Through a study of the recent biography of Hamilton along with the music and stage production of Hamilton, we will consider both the biographical and mythical Alexander Hamilton in order to understand his era and our own.

M. Forster's Lucy Honeychurch, who 'entered into a more solid world when she opened the piano,' to James Baldwin's Sonny, who 'moved in an atmosphere which wasn't like theirs at all,' fictional musicians encounter trouble when negotiating the conflicting realms of art and society. Experts in one kind of expression, they fail in others. What draws these characters to music? What does it offer them? What is its value to us? In the musical novel and short story, we encounter music as an agent of violence, of consolation, of transcendence and redemption as well as damnation. We witness empathy through music, but we also learn that shared feeling can be both beautiful and dangerous, that music unites and divides. This course combines the close reading of literary texts (as well as works of literary theory and musicology) with the examination of the musical contexts that inform and inspire them. We will explore, for example, the relationship between Kazuo Ishiguro's novel The Unconsoled and Richard Wagner's music drama Parsifal. We will talk about syncopation in 'jazz' by Charles Mingus and Toni Morrison. We will watch Marguerite Duras and Katherine Mansfield turn innocuous music lessons into spaces of wretchedness. We will try to understand what David Mitchell's young composer Robert Frobisher means when he says, 'One writes music because winter is eternal and because, if one didn't, the wolves and blizzards would be at one's throat all the sooner.'\",\n    CourseMaterials:\n      \"https://www.bkstr.com/webApp/discoverView?bookstore_id-1=1306&term_id-1=202110&div-1=&dept-1=ENGL&course-1=225&section-1=01\",\n    Notes: \"*First-Year Course only; cross-listed with MUSI 225-01*\",\n    Sections: [\n      {\n        id: \"01\",\n        Day: \"M W F\",\n        Time: [24.0, 13.0],\n        Room: \"MUSIC 228\",\n        Instructor: \"Mark Mazullo\",\n        Availability: [16, 16],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n  {\n    CourseKey: \"MUSI 294-01\",\n    ClassCode: [\"MUSI 294-01\"],\n    Title: \"Uyghur Culture and Society\",\n    Departments: [\"Music\"],\n    DistributionReq: \"\",\n    GeneralEds: [],\n    Description:\n      \"The Uyghur are Turkic-speaking Central Asians residing in a minority “autonomous region” called Xinjiang or Sinkiang in northwest China, where they are often unwillingly one of the 55 official minority nationalities.

Its central concerns are: (1) to understand the place of music in social and cultural life, (2) to gain an appreciation of the musical style and rhetoric that characterizes each of the periods we study, and (3) to develop students' abilities in communicating, in writing and the spoken word, what they have learned about this music and the culture in which it was produced. Course activities will take several forms, including lectures, musical analyses, and performances. Lectures will introduce key terms and concepts and will address broader concerns of cultural life (including composer biographies). In-class analysis and performance will lead to a more detailed understanding of key works. Examinations will test students' retention of course listening and lecture/discussion/reading material. Essays will give students the opportunity to delve deeper into critical and musical analysis, and to sharpen their prose, specifically with respect to writing about music.

This body of thought is worthy of sustained study for two reasons. First, it is one of the glories of human civilization. In seeking to answer the timeless question 'how we should live our lives as individuals' and 'how we should live together in peace and justice' late medieval political thinkers produced a body of political thought second to none in the history of human philosophical speculation. Second, late medieval political thought is worthy of study because it gave rise to many of the concepts that continue to shape our collective lives today (including state sovereignty, separation of church and state, constitutionalism, just war, property rights, 'the people,' nationalism, democracy, rule-of-law, and human rights). Indeed, it is impossible to really understand contemporary political life without delving deeply into the way in which late medieval thinkers engaged with the big political issues of their day. The main goal of this course is to provide a solid introduction to the political thought of this crucially important era in human history. In it, we will critically examine the relevant works of thinkers such as St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, John of Paris, Marsilius of Padua, Bartolus of Sasseferato, and Baldus de Ubaldi. To the extent that they shed light on late medieval thought, we will also touch on classical political theorists such as Aristotle and Cicero as well as Muslim and Jewish thinkers such as ibn Sina, Moshe ben Maimon, and ibn Rusd.\",\n    CourseMaterials:\n      \"https://www.bkstr.com/webApp/discoverView?bookstore_id-1=1306&term_id-1=202110&div-1=&dept-1=POLI&course-1=266&section-1=01\",\n    Notes: \"\",\n    Sections: [\n      {\n        id: \"01\",\n        Day: \"M W F\",\n        Time: [9.67, 10.67],\n        Room: \"\",\n        Instructor: \"Andrew Latham\",\n        Availability: [25, 25],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n  {\n    CourseKey: \"PHIL 321/POLI 268\",\n    ClassCode: [\"PHIL 321\", \"POLI 268\"],\n    Title: \"Contemporary Social and Political Philosophy\",\n    Departments: [\"Philosophy\", \"Political Science\"],\n    DistributionReq: \"Humanities\",\n    GeneralEds: [],\n    Description:\n      \"This course will focus on some central topics in contemporary Anglo-American (or 'analytic') social and political philosophy.

We shall examine Spinoza’s entailed radical revision in understanding both the “political” and the “environment.” Beyond Spinoza’s Ethics and his Theologico-Political and Political treatises, we shall read major commentators both on Spinoza’s ethical and political theory—e.g., Louis Althusser, Étienne Balibar, Edwin Curley, Gilles Deleuze, Michael Hardt, Pierre Macherey, Warren Montag, Antonio Negri—and on his role in environmental ethics and Deep Ecology—e.g., Bill Devall, Leslie Le Grange, K.L.F.

We will examine critical issues such as the limits of authority and the freedom of choice; the origins of modern subjectivity/ the pursuit of the ideal and the impossible; the conflict between individualism and nationalism, and that between empire and colonies; the rise of the bourgeoisie and the transition to a secular world; the crisis of reason; and the autonomy of art.

In all of these instances, it’s useful to consider how and why the specter of transness is raised. What social and political work does that figure do? This course will examine transness as a practice of gender transgression, rather than solely an identity category, one which is historically and geographically contingent. In doing so, we will ask: What is trans? How do race, class, gender, sexuality, and disability structure trans lives and communities? How have key institutions within the US constructed ideas about gender normativity and policed gender transgression? How has that policing impacted and shaped trans life? What is the relationship between feminism and trans people and trans liberation? How have trans people envisioned and fought for social justice?

We travel through all kinds of ‘post’ and ‘neo’-liberalism, humanism, feminism, nationalism, and colonialism-and how they intertwine in our own lived experiences.  Some topics: protest against gender, sexual, race, economic, and linguistic bio-regimes, revolts of the colonized and marginalized, and resistant/ liberatory creations in art, technology, and media. Authors include Linda Tuhiwai Smith, Michel Foucault, Theresa Cha, Silvia Federici, Noam Chomsky, Ta-Nehisi Coates, bell hooks, Chela Sandoval, and Gayatri Spivak, among others.  At the end of the course, we will all know a little more about where we stand. People from all disciplines welcome. Prerequisite(s): Sophomore or junior standing or permission of instructor, and at least one course in the department (core course recommended, cross-listed accepted).\",\n    CourseMaterials:\n
